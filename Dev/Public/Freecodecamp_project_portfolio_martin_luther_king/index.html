          Here's a time line for Dr Martin Luther King Jnr's life :
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>

          <li>
            <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
            in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
            how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US

            <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
            laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
            returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
            pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
            Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
            work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
            other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology

            leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
            pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
            different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
            varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
            season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
            with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
            well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
            strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
            mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population

          <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

            <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
            supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
            we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.Says that GM crops
            are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
            plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
            people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
