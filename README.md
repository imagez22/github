# github
My public repository for FCC.
I will put here my freecodecamp.org curriculum tasks(vanilla javascript, html+css, front-end frameworks) projects and any other learning experience  I want to share with the public. FCC uses codepen.io for assessment...On few occasions I wrote my code at codepen instead of my default IDE then committed to github. My codepen account has  more since its my to-go place when learning online.(https://codepen.io/imagez01)
