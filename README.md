# github
My public repository.
I will put here my freecodecamp curriculum tasks(vanilla javascript, html+css, front-end frameworks) projects and any other work I want to share with the public. FCC uses codepen.io for assessment...On few occasions I wrote my code at codepen instead of my default IDE then committed to github. my codepen.
